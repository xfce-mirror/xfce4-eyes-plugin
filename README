ABOUT
==========================================================================
xfce4-eyes-plugin is a xfce4 panel plugin that adds eyes which watch
your every step. Scary!

Portions of the xfce4-eyes code were taken from geyes. These, and the rest of
the code are licensed under the terms of the GNU General public license; see
the COPYING file.


USAGE
==========================================================================
Simply add the plugin to the panel and select a theme in the
configuration dialog. Depending on how big the eyes are and where on
the panel you want the eyes to appear, you might find changing the
single-row option useful. It becomes effective only in multi-row mode.


DEBUGGING AND REPORTING BUGS
==========================================================================
Before reporting bugs or asking for new features, please consolidate
the Xfce bug tracker at https://bugzilla.xfce.org, because your issue
or request might have been reported already or be in planning.


BUILD REQUIREMENTS AND DEPENDENCIES
==========================================================================
If you have installed Xfce, you already have all required dependencies
installed.


EASY BUILD INSTRUCTIONS
==========================================================================
If you're interesting in building the plugin yourself, these
instructions provided here will work for most users. If not, please
look at the INSTALL file or ask at a forum for your linux distribution
or try the methods explained on http://www.xfce.org/community. Make
sure you have installed the needed dependencies (see previous section
BUILD REQUIREMENTS AND DEPENDENCIES).

For the panel being able to find the plugin, it is important to set
the proper prefix. The prefix is the place in the filesystem where the
plugin files gets installed. It has to match the prefix used for
building the panel. There's nothing the plugin can do about that
requirement. When you're using the panel provided by the package
management system of your distribution, then the prefix is in most
cases /usr, otherwise the default prefix is /usr/local.

If you want to install the current version from git, execute the
following command in the plugin project directory (make sure you have
GNU automake installed!):

1a) ./autogen.sh --prefix=/usr

Otherwise, if you've downloaded the tarball from e.g.
http://archive.xfce.org/, issue the following command:

1b) ./configure --prefix=/usr

If 1a) or 1b) fail, you should receive an error message telling you
the cause for the failure (e.g. missings libraries). If you're missing
a dependency you need to install it using the package management
system of your distribution. Distributions commonly have two versions
of a software package: One containing the supplementary files needed
for compiling other packages, and the other one providing the runtime
libraries etc. While the latter is usually installed, the former often
is not, so better check this.

Note: To solve distribution-specific problems the most efficient way
is to ask at a forum for your distribution, not on a general forum.

Then for both cases:
2) make

If this fails, file a bug on https://bugzilla.xfce.org, or send a mail
to the xfce mailing list and provide make output.

Finally, and usually as root:
3) make install

Note: Depending on your prefix, this might overwrite an existing
version of the plugin.

You can later uninstall the plugin (as root) with
4) make uninstall

The panel should then recognize the new plugin, if it doesn't try to
restart it using xfce4-panel -r. If it still doesn't work after that
try to ask for help somewhere (forums, mailing lists, #xfce on
IRC). Please do not report such problems on the bug tracker.


TRANSLATING THE PLUGIN FOR YOUR LANGUAGE
==========================================================================
If you need help getting started with translating the plugin into your
language, please visit https://translations.xfce.org/ and absorb the
information that is there, especially on the *Help* page! There is
other useful documentation available on this topic, try this wiki page
for a start:
https://wiki.xfce.org/translations/translation_guidance_in_xfce

TRANSLATORS, PLEASE MAKE SURE YOU CHECK YOUR FILE FOR ERRORS BEFORE
UPLOADING IT! Otherwise, it will break compilation of the plugin. It
is easy to do this with the following command (where file.po is the po
file of your language):
msgfmt -c --check-accelerators=_ -v -o /dev/null <file.po>
